INTRODUCTION

Turning to statistics, we can see that 54% of the country's population aged 24 to 64 have higher education and this percentage is only growing every year. People graduate from educational institutions in order to get the desired profession and knowledge in life, and at the same time they can only hope that teachers will be able to correctly assess their knowledge and in the future receive the so desired diploma.
This project just serves as an auxiliary program for teachers in monitoring students and reliable storage of information. The project is an information base that stores information about the grades and progress of students. Also, in cases of need, there are the necessary opportunities to instantly determine the student's average score, as well as all failures and all unsatisfactory marks.
Also, this project was designed for a specific higher institution for maximum quick interaction with the database and, if necessary, can be adjusted to any other educational institution as soon as possible.
And so, approaching the results, we can say that the project was designed and implemented to optimize the system in educational institutions for faster and more accurate monitoring of student progress.
      This project was implemented in the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 programming environment in the C # language and uses the Microsoft Access database.
